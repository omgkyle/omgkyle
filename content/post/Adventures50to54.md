It was a productive day of leveling for my little rogue, starting out with completing off the Western Plaguelands zone. Everything went pretty smooth in finishing off the zone which is always welcome with no deaths, which after being used to only leveling with Heirloom gear is sometimes easier said then done.

Moving past the Western Plaguelands I headed into the Eastern side where things got a little more tricky. Things mostly went smoothly, but well sometimes being able to either heal or having that extra good gear really does come in handy. If you watch the stream from Youtube you will notice I did actually die here when fighting the Lone Hunter, damn wolf and his bleeding me to death; thankfully I got the killing blow first. Once I completed that I was able to thankfully finish off my questing with out any further death.

So this little toon started out with nothing... ok well close to nothing. The only thing that I sent this toon from my boosted 110 Warlock was some frostweave bags. This was a brand new account, so really did not have to much to start with. That being said with using TSM (Trade Skill Master); which I HIGHLY recommend getting, I was able to turn 0 gold into as it stands right now nearly 4000 Gold.

The way I have done this is mostly through picking up the professions herbalism and mining, both gathering professions that has mats that sell for a decent price (sale price may vary). I also have gotten slightly lucky with some higher selling random drops from mobs, though even then nothing over 500 Gold to this point. 

After every leveling session before logging off for the day/night I would make sure to get myself to the auction house. As of now its much more painful becasue the closest one to me is down in Ironforge. I let TSM run its post scans and then put everything I can up for the night in hopes of it selling, and to this point it has done rather well for me. This has helped me easily get my ground mount training and already have my entry level flying paid for, and now nearly epic flying training for level 70.
