Here at OMGKyle, I do have a strict set of rules for when it comes to comments made on any posts. If you are a dick to myself or other commenters you'll be banned simple as that. So the most simple way of stating this is just... <i>Don't Be A DICK!</i>


### Simple Rules For Comment Review ###
* Use of any curse words and/or slurs that is on the blacklist will find your comment being flagged for review and it will not appear in the comments until it has been reviewed.

* Sometimes mistakes happen with the comment engine and the gnomes flag something that shouldn't be flagged, it happens.


### How To Get A Comment Deleted ###
* Personal attacks towards either myself or another commenter, remember don't be a dick. So please don't attack another user, its a quick way to get your comment deleted and possibly be banned as well.

* Hate speech or any kind of intentional dick behavior. Basically any type of biggoted speech is going to get your comment deleted... and you will be banned, the gnomes are good at that kind of thing so don't try them.


### How To Get Banned ###
* Read any of the above things, if you do any of them you may be banned without warning. Depending how sevre the infraction is you may get a warning, ultimately this is a community that embraces gaming and inclusion so if thats not your thing and you decide to do any of the above you likely will be banned.
