I am a mild mannored IT worker by day and avid gamer by night, well early night anyways, lets not get to crazy. 

I have been a gamer most of my life ever since getting my first console a Super Nintendo for Christmas, it was the Donkey Kong bundle if you really must know. Spoiler alert... Best Christmas EVER! And that is what started me on my path of gaming ever since. I have owned all major consoles, other then Sega ones, sorry about that Sega. And recently have once again rekindled my gaming love for Warcraft. 

Through all this I was never one to really want to show off my gameplay skill because in reality I am not the best at gaming. I am that one teammate that will run in guns a blazing ruining any sense of stealth the rest of the team may of had.But its fun all the same, I like to think of it as making other need to improvise and think fast.

Enough about all of this though, I have now started streaming, especially my Warcraft escapades but will be adding more gaming content as I continue to play. I hope everyone enjoys the journey with me and has some fun as well!
